# Project Title

Just after the title, introduce your project by describing attractively what the project is about and what is the main problem that inspires you to create this project or what is the main contribution for the potential user of your project.

Currently, loan officers spend time digging into each coutomer information and seeing whether or not they qualify for a loan and which bank will accept that indivdual coustomer. Currently, both coustomers and loan officers alike spend too much on this aspect of the loan process and this project looks to speed that up while delivering for our coustomers and the bootom line! This project allows users to determine, more easily if a candidate qualifies for a loan or not. This also allows the user to easily see which banks would accept a given coustomer's indidivual loan information. This will speed allow loan officers to go through more coustomers and better serve coustomers without delay.

The user of this project will be able to easily see which bank will take there loan if any.
